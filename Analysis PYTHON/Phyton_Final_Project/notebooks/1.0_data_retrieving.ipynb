    "# Retrieving data from NoFluffJobs\n",
    "The first part of the exercise consists in retrieving data from the NoFluffJobs homepage. Complete the exercise following the steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Write a function that takes two parameters (job name and page number), and returns the HTML code of that page,\n",
    "2. Write a function that takes one parameter (website code) and returns the information saying whether there are more offers on the page (True or False),\n",
    "3. Write a function that takes one parameter (job name), and then in a loop, starting from 1 page:\n",
    "    - Retrieves the code of the given page,\n",
    "    - Checks if there are still ads on the page,\n",
    "    - If there are, it saves the HTML code to disk and goes to the next page,\n",
    "    - If there are not, it terminates the operation,\n",
    "Remember to use previously written functions in step 3.\n",
    "\n",
    "At this stage, we do not process the data yet, we retrieve it as it is available.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the script for the following jobs:\n",
    "- data analyst,\n",
    "- data scientist,\n",
    "- data engineer.\n",
    "\n",
    "NOTE:\n",
    "For the website to generate its entire content after opening it needs to be clicked. In other words the process of loading the website should look as follows:\n",
    "    - open the job offers page,\n",
    "    - click any object on the page (e.g. accept cookies).\n",
    "\n",
    "# File names\n",
    "We will adopt the following file naming convention:\n",
    "\n",
    "'{job_name}_{page_number}.html'\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: data analyst_1.html is going to mean the list of data analyst job offers from page one. The files should be saved in the /data/raw directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Hints:\n",
    "Remember to add a time interval between every page transition, e.g. 5 seconds,\n",
    "As a url to be opened by the browser, you can use the following template:\n",
    "'https://nofluffjobs.com/pl/jobs?criteria={job_name}&page={page_number}'\n",
    "\n",
    "to retrieve the HTML content of the page you can use:browser.page_source,\n",
    "Because we do not how how many pages we are going to have for each job, you can use a while loop,\n",
    "if you want to stop executing the loop you can use the break keyword,"
