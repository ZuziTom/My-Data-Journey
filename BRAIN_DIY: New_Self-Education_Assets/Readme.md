# Brain Diy

Welcome to the Brain Diy repository! This folder contains various self-learning scripts and topics that I have explored and mastered after completing my course. Below is a list of the scripts currently available, along with a brief description of each.

## Contents

1. **Python Sweetviz**
    - **File:** `Python_Sweetviz.ipynb`
    - **Description:** This Jupyter notebook showcases the usage of Sweetviz for quick Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). Sweetviz is a Python library that generates beautiful, highly detailed visualizations and summaries of datasets. This script demonstrates how to use Sweetviz to gain insights into your data quickly.

2. **Pivottablejs**
    - **File:** `Pivottablejs.ipynb`
    - **Description:** This Jupyter notebook demonstrates the use of Pivottablejs, an open-source JavaScript Pivot Table (aka Pivot Grid, Pivot Chart, Cross-Tab) implementation with drag'n'drop functionality. It allows for interactive exploration and visualization of data, making it easier to understand and manipulate data from various perspectives.
