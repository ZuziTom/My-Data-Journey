# Welcome to my Data Analysis Journey repository! üìäüêçüìâ

This repository chronicles my learning journey as a data analyst through the Coders Lab [course](https://coderslab.cz/cz/kurzy/data-analyst). I've gained comprehensive skills in data analysis using Excel, Python, and SQL. Additionally, I've learned to create compelling data visualizations using Tableau and Power BI. Explore this repository to see my projects, code samples, and insights from various analytical exercises.

All analyses were conducted following the data science process:
- encompassing problem framing,
- data gathering,
- data cleaning and transformation,
- exploratory data analysis,
- comprehensive statistical inference - in-depth analysis,
- communicating the results (visualization and storytelling).

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into the following five folders

1. **MS Excel Analyses**: Contains Excel files used for various data analysis tasks. This includes data cleaning, transformation, pivot tables, and visualizations done using Excel.
2. **Python Analyses**: Includes Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts where data cleaning, transformation, and analysis were performed. Each notebook is well-documented to provide insights into the analytical process.
3. **SQL Analyses**: Features SQL scripts and queries used to extract, manipulate, and analyze data stored in relational databases.
4. **Visualizations**: Houses Tableau and Power BI files, as well as static images and interactive dashboards created during the data visualization exercises.
5. **Self learning**: Contains additional projects and analyses undertaken after the completion of the Coders Lab course. This includes work on predictions, econometrics, further analyses, and Python profiling.
