# Welcome to my Data Analysis Journey repository! 📊🐍📉

This repository chronicles my learning journey as a data analyst through the Coders Lab course. I've gained comprehensive skills in data analysis using Excel, Python, and SQL. Additionally, I've learned to create compelling data visualizations using Tableau and Power BI. Explore this repository to see my projects, code samples, and insights from various analytical exercises.

All analyses were conducted following the data science process:
- encompassing problem framing,
- data gathering,
- data cleaning and transformation,
- exploratory data analysis,
- comprehensive statistical inference - in-depth analysis,
- communicating the results (visualization and storytelling).
